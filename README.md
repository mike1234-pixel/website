# My Professional Portfolio

This is my professional portfolio built with React and TypeScript.

## Description

This portfolio showcases my skills and experience as a developer. The data is stored in the `data` directory under `src`. The portfolio contains several sections including Projects, Skills, Experience and Gallery (About Me).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mike1234-pixel/website.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd website
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser to view the portfolio.

## Data

The site doesn't warrant a backend so the data for the portfolio is stored in the `data` directory under `src`. The data is organized into separate JSON files for each section.

## Deployment

To deploy the portfolio, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build in the `build` directory. You can then deploy the contents of the `build` directory to a web server or hosting service of your choice.
